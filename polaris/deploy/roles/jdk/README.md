2. **Fetch Asset Information:** Retrieves metadata for the specified JDK version using the Adoptium API.
3. **Download and Extract JDK:** Downloads the JDK package and extracts it to the specified location.
4. **Manage Certificates:** Downloads and imports certificates into the JDK's cacerts file.
5. **Configure JCE:** Downloads and installs the JCE policy files (for JDK 8).
6. **Patch Intention:** Patches the intention with the JDK version.

## Example Playbooks

Use this role to deploy an Adoptium OpenJDK package in one of three ways: (1) the latest version of the default major version, (2) the latest
version of a given major version or (3) a specific pinned version. The role uses the Adoptium API to get release information and download packages.

### Deploy latest version of the default major version

  roles:
    - name: jdk
      vars:
        proxy_env: '{{ env_vars }}'
```

  roles:
    - name: jdk
      vars:
        jdk_major_version: '8'
